In the Bank Account System example, we can define the class relationships as follows:

Bank Class:

A Bank can have multiple Customers.
A Bank can have multiple Accounts.
Customer Class:

A Customer can have multiple Accounts.
A Customer belongs to a Bank.
Account Class:

An Account belongs to a Customer.
An Account has a balance.
Here's a more detailed breakdown:

The Bank class contains a list of customers who have accounts with the bank. Each customer is associated with that bank.

The Customer class represents a bank customer. Each customer can have multiple accounts, such as savings accounts, checking accounts, etc. The customer is associated with a specific bank.

The Account class represents a customer's account. Each account belongs to a specific customer and has an associated balance.

Here's a simplified Python code example illustrating these class relationships:

python
Copy code
class Bank:
    def __init__(self, bank_name):
        self.bank_name = bank_name
        self.customers = []

    def add_customer(self, customer):
        self.customers.append(customer)

class Customer:
    def __init__(self, customer_id, name):
        self.customer_id = customer_id
        self.name = name
        self.accounts = []

    def add_account(self, account):
        self.accounts.append(account)

class Account:
    def __init__(self, account_id, account_type, balance):
        self.account_id = account_id
        self.account_type = account_type
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount

# Create a bank
my_bank = Bank("My Bank")

# Create a customer
customer1 = Customer(1, "John Doe")

# Create accounts for the customer
account1 = Account(101, "Savings", 1000)
account2 = Account(102, "Checking", 500)

# Add accounts to the customer
customer1.add_account(account1)
customer1.add_account(account2)

# Add the customer to the bank
my_bank.add_customer(customer1)
In this example, you can see how a bank can have multiple customers, and each customer can have multiple accounts. The classes and their relationships reflect the design of the Bank Account System.
